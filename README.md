# Diabetes_prediction_GaussianNB
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates a diabetes prediction model using Gaussian Naive Bayes classification. The notebook covers the following steps:

Data Preparation:
  Loading the Data: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
  Splitting the Data: The data is divided into training and testing sets using train_test_split to evaluate the performance of the model.
  
Model Training:
  Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB): The Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier is used to train the model on the training dataset to predict the likelihood of diabetes.
  
Model Evaluation:
  Performance Metrics: The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using various metrics provided by sklearn.metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix.
  
This notebook showcases the process of building and assessing a machine learning model for diabetes prediction, including data preparation, model training, and comprehensive performance evaluation.
